TODO:

    * ADD a third an final enemy (that sways in the sky)

    * Change white background to something less harsh

    * Add a way to save and load and display prior scores
        ** Add a highscore feature -> Added as of 3/15/22
        *** Perhaps in the future, I will flesh this feature out more (add name and date perhaps)... but not today

    * Harrass spencer for some pixelArt
