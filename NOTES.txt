TODO:

    addJumpPts logic needs refactored. With multiple enemies, I need to 
    re-assign the bool jumped logic to each individual "enemyBox" then check 
    whether or not the enemyBox is jumped (iterate through 0 - eBox.size() ), 
    then draw the +2 (or +5) sprite. 

    So.. refacotr the addJumpt logic so that it no longer belings to game.h,but 
    to enemyBox.h, then have a function that checks the boolean value
    and a function that switches it on and off.   




    Side note: I understand now why I call " if(score.pointTimerSecondElapsed() < 1) " 
    in gamedraw() ( game.h ). It is so that the +2 score is drawn for about a second 
    as you jump over the enemy
